# K-Means Algorithm Implementation Using Python

The user specifies the number of clusters and the max. number of iterations.

The program then reads in relevant data from a csv file and runs the k-means algorithm on the data.

In this example, the dataset consists of a list of countries and shows each country's birthrate (per 1000) and life expectancy in 2008.

After running the alorithm, the program outputs the following:

1. The number of countries belonging to each cluster.

2. The list of countries belonging to each cluster.

3. The mean life expectancy and birth rate for each cluster.

After each iteration, the program outputs the value of the objective function so that the user can watch the objective function converge.
